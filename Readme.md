# Node.js Backend Project Boilerplate (SQL Databases)

This Node.js Backend Project Boilerplate is designed to provide a solid foundation for building backend applications using SQL databases. It follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture and includes major folders to organize your code effectively.

## Features

- MVC Architecture: Easily manage your application's components with clear separation of concerns.
- SQL Database Support: Built to work with SQL databases for data storage and retrieval.
- Organized Codebase: Major folders for different components to keep your codebase clean and maintainable.
- Ready-to-Use Structure: Clone this repository as a starting point for any new backend project.

## Folder Structure

The project follows a well-organized folder structure to help you easily manage your codebase:

- **config**: Contains configuration files for your application, such as database configurations, environment variables, etc.
- **controllers**: Handles the application's logic by interacting with models and sending responses to clients.
- **middlewares**: Includes custom middleware functions for request processing and handling.
- **migrations**: Stores database migration files to manage database schema changes.
- **models**: Defines database models and interacts with the database through Sequelize ORM.
- **repositories**: Implements data access logic to interact with the database models.
- **routes**: Contains route files that define API endpoints and link them to corresponding controllers.
- **seeders**: Stores database seed files to populate initial data into the database.
- **services**: Contains business logic and application services.
- **utils**: Holds utility functions and helper modules to be used throughout the application.
- **logs**: Used to store application logs for debugging and monitoring.

## Prerequisites

Before using this project boilerplate, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (>=12.x)
- npm (>=6.x)
- SQL Database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite)

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/your_username/nodejs-backend-boilerplate.git
cd nodejs-backend-boilerplate
```

2. Install dependencies using npm:

```
npm install
```

3. Configure your database connection in the `config/database.js` file.

4. Run database migrations to set up the database schema:

```
npx sequelize-cli db:migrate
```

5. Optionally, you can run database seeders to populate initial data:

```
npx sequelize-cli db:seed:all
```

6. Start the development server:

```
npm start
```

You can now begin building your backend application on top of this boilerplate!
